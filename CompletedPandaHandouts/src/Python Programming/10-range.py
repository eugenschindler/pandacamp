#range generates a list of numbers
#range(-3,3) generates the list [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
#range(1, 10, 2) generates the list [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

#for loops repeat over a list of numbers

#keep range(-3,3), but modify the position to make a line of pandas
#from the top left of the screen to the bottom right of the screen
for i in range(-3,3):

#use a for loop and the range function to make a line of pandas
#walking toward the screen

#use a for loop and the range function to make a circle of pandas
