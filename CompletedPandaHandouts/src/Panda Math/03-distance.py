# Measuring distance using "dist"

p2 = P3(2,0,0)

# Display the distance between the balls using "text"

start()
# The position of the ball is its center.
# Observe the distance as the balls move together  and
# then apart.  Change the trajectories - what happens to the distance?
# How is this distance computed?
# Change one of the balls to move according to a slider and
# place the other at (0,0,0).  How does the distance work in this case?
