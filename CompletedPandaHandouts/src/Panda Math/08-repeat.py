# Next, we'll make it easier to express repetition in an interpolant
# if you use "repeat(3, i)" this would repeat an interpolant 3 times.
# Rewrite the previous example using repeat.
# Then add another repeat that makes the whole thing including the
# initial "at" repeat twice.

# Finally, take out the slider and use repeat and "time" to make three different
# models move in different ways.  You can use interpolation on HPR values.
