# Take two photos from today's activities and place the .jpg in this folder.  Then
# bring it into Panda:
# Create a rectangle with three points which will be the bottum left, bottum right and
# lower right. Try setting the color of the rectangle.
# Set one picture to be the texture and the other to be side2.
# Make the picture alittle bit bigger, and Set the HPR so that the photo spins.
# Make a new picture in front and try to over lap them.
