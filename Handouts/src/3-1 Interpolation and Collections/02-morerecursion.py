# We can generalize this idea a little.
# This time, write a pandaLine function that takes three arguments:
#  The number of pandas
#  The location of the next panda
#  The distance between pandas

# You need to make a panda at the right place and figure out how
# number, loc, and dist will change in the recursion
        


# Make a line of pandas starting at (0,0,0) moving one unit to the right

pandaLine(5, P3(0,0,0), P3(1,0,0))
# Make another line starting at (0,0,0) moving 2 back

# This time, use mouseControl to allow the camera to be moved around

# Can you use any model you want instead of just pandas?
