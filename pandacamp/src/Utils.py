# Place a model under control of the mouse
# Note: no way to change pitch / roll.  Maybe add these controls from the keypad.

# Note: this differs from mouseControl in that the original position is
# not at the origin and that negation is needed to make the world move
# with the mouse instead of oppositely.  That is, raising the camera makes
# the objects in the scene go down.
