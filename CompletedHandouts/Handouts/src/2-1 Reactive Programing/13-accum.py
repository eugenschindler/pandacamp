# The accum function starts with a given value and then
# uses events that change the value in some way.
# These functions change a number:
#   add(x): add x to the number
#   sub(x): subtract x from the number
#   times(x): multiply the number by x
#   const(x): change the number to x

# This uses the "a" key to add .1 to the position
# Can you:
#   Add the other three events (remember to use + to combine events)
#   Start the panda out at z = -2 instead of z = 0?
#   Use a second set of keys to control the roll?
