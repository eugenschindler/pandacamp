# Sphere have a lot of predifined textures.  Create a scene with:
#  A sphere with the camplogo on it - make the sphere turn
#  Another sphere with a planet on it - also make this one turn
#  A large sphere with a sky texture of some sort.  You have to make it's size
#   negative to put the texture inside the sphere.  The size should be big enough to encompass the camera and all
#   scene objects - something like -100.
