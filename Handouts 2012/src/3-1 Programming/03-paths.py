from Panda import *

# A function which takes a parameter t and returns a position defines a path.
# This path goes up and down.
def path(t):
    return P3(t-2, 0, sin(t*2))

# Place a bunch of pandas on this path:
for x in range(5):
    panda(position = path(time-x))

# Challenges:
#   Make the pandas follows this path forward
#   Launch a panda along this path every second
#   Make the pandas speed up as they follow the path
#   Create a socond path that controls the HPR of the panda
