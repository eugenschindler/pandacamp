from Panda import *

# A function is how programmers are able to reuse code - do the same thing more than once, perhaps in slightly different ways

# This function creates a rotating panda at a given point, named p:

def f(p):
    panda(position = p, hpr = HPR(time, 0, 0))

# Now use f to create a rotating panda:

f(P3(1,0,0))

# Things to do:
#   Add another call to f that creates a second rotating panda
#   Change f to create two pandas, side by side, rotating in opposite directions
#   Add a second parameter to f to give the pair of pandas a color.  You'll have to
#     change the calls to add this parameter unless you give it a default value
