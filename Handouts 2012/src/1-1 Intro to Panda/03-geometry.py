panda()

# Place a green floor under the panda
# The floor should be at z = 0 and go from -2 to 2 in x and -2 to 2 in y
# The rectangle function takes three points: lower left, lower right, and upper left
# use texture = color to set the color or texture = "image.jpg" to set the texture from a picture

# Add a slider to move the camera up and down.

# Add a picture behind the panda of a real panda - make this connect to the
# floor behind the panda

# You can use the sphere model to create a skydome so that you don't see the gray background
# Use sphere(size = -1000, texture="texture.jpg") to create a skydome.
# Look into panda/lib/pictures for some domes.
# You can download a dome from the Internet and place it in the same folder as the program
