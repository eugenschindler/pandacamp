# Rectangles and photos
# Take two photos from today's activities and place the .jpg in this folder.  Then
# bring it into Panda:
# Create a rectangle with three points which will be the bottum left, bottum right and
# lower right. Try setting the color of the rectangle.
# Set one picture to be the texture and the other to be side2.
# Make the picture a little bit bigger, and Set the HPR so that the photo spins.
# Make a new picture in front and try to over lap them.

rectangle(P3(0,0,0), P3(1,0,0), P3(0,0,1), texture = "realpanda.jpg")

# Use GIMP to create a photo with your picture / name in it and display it
