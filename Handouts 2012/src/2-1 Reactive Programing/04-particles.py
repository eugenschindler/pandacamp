# You can give these effects a duration - just add duration = n, where n is in seconds

# You can set the position of an effect (or any other model) based on the position of
# another model.  Make a panda that moves left and right using the arrow keys.  Set him
# on fire by positioning a fireish at the same place (or better just a little higher)

# Instead of having the panda on fire all the time, start the fire when you hit a space.
# Make the fire die out after 2 seconds.  See if you can make it get smaller as it dies out - use localTime to do this.
# localTime is like time except that it starts at 0 when the model is created, not at the start of the program
