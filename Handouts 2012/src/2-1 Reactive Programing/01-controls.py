# You have already used one reactive value: time.  This is a number that starts at 0 and keeps going up.
# Here are some more:
#  mouse - this is a 2-D point, where the x and y coordinate are between -1 and 1.  0,0 is at the center.  You use getX and getY to access
#          individual coordinates
#  lbutton, rbutton: these are boolean (true / false) values from the mouse buttons.  You can use this in a "choose", for example
#                    choose(lbutton, 0, 1) which is 0 when the button is pressed and 1 when not pressed.
#  slider: create a slider on the screen.

p = panda()
grassScene()

# Use each of these to move the panda in some way.  You can set either the position or the hpr or even the color
# 
p.position = P3(time, 0, 0)   # Example: use the time to move the panda right
# Try to use the mouse to control the panda in some way - the 2-D coordinate of the mouse
# can't be used in the 3-D world directly.
# Make a slider to control the panda position
# Use a sine function to make the panda move back and forth
