from Panda import *

# A for loop allows you to do something more than once.  For example, this puts a row of pandas on the screen:

for x in range(5):
    panda(position = P3(x-2, 0, 0))

# Note that each panda sees a different x value.  The range(5) means all numbers between 0 and 4 (there are 5 of them)

# Modify this so that each panda has a different velocity or rotation.
# Modify again to use interpolation to move each panda to the same location as before.  Start all of the pandas
# in the same place.  You could make some of them move faster by using the x value to control interpolation time

start()
