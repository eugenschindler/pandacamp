# Add another option to this menu for the jeep.
# Make a new menu that allows you to select "spin" or "tumble".  Hold onto the
# most recently selected item with a hold and inside change set either the heading
# (for spin) or pitch (for tumble) to be localTime.  To look at the
# current value of this you'll need a .now() - this only works on signals that
# are part of an object so you need to put the hold inside "world" - as in
# world.todo = hold("Spin", m)
